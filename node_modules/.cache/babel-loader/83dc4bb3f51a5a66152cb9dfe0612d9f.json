With sleep, eating, jobs, and other responsibilities, you never\r\n                  really get the full 48 hours to work. Furthermore, you must balance interesting\r\n                  ideas with a manageable scope. Creating a game under these circumstances is\r\n                  intense, so I was a little worried when I reached out to others for their experience\r\n                  (this article would be such a downer if everyone had a horrible time).\r\n                  </p>\r\n                   \r\n                  <p>\r\n                  Lucky people had a great time participating in Global Game Jam, and\r\n                  although there were many hardships, creating a game was a valuable learning\r\n                  experience. I asked what was the most difficult part of making a game in under 48hours and a common thread was trying to not be too ambitious. Having a large\r\n                  scope can lead to crunch and failing to finish your game in time. Rafael Perez, who\r\n                  worked on ​Aqua Hero​, added that synchronizing tasks between team members was\r\n                  difficult. He says that “our different skills fit perfectly to make a game, but the\r\n                  toughest part was to make them work together by using tools like github, and since\r\n                  you have to choose between working or managing at times that made it harder.”\r\n                  </p>\r\n\r\n                  <p>\r\n                  One of the unique opportunities that our game jam provided was the chance\r\n                  to work with different disciplines. Every team that was formed had at least one\r\n                  programmer, artists, and sound designer/musician. When I asked what it was like to\r\n                  work with others who had different specializations, the response was\r\n                  overwhelmingly positive. Christian Acosta was part of the team that made ​Bark and\r\n                  Found​ and said that working with other talents was “a great learning experience.\r\n                  Not only do you learn their perspective on creating the game, but often you learn a\r\n                  little about their specialty.”\r\n                  </p>\r\n\r\n                  <p>\r\n                  Even though this game jam has ended, the jammers' relationships with each\r\n                  other have not! Creating new connections with others opens up future\r\n                  opportunities for collaboration. I asked Amy Devorkin, a team member for ​Little\r\n                  Echo​, if she would work with her team again and she said “I would gladly work with\r\n                  any of them again. I feel like we had good vibes and let me work the way I like to\r\n                  while still keeping me on track to finishing.” The best games aren’t made alone, so if\r\n                  you’re looking to form a team around an awesome pitch, then you should know\r\n                  people of different talents who would be willing to collaborate.\r\n                  </p>\r\n\r\n                  <p>\r\n                  Finally, when asked if she made a friend, she responded saying, “I wouldn’t\r\n                  say that I made a new friend, but that’s only because the distance and discord lag\r\n                  makes my social anxieties more pronounced. I certainly hope I can work again and\r\n                  possibly become friends.”\r\n                  </p>\r\n\r\n                </div>\r\n              </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          <div className=\"right\">\r\n            <div className=\"content\">\r\n              <div className=\"print-menu\">\r\n                <a className=\"print-link\" href={pdf} target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\r\n                  Download Article\r\n                </a>\r\n                <hr className=\"line\"></hr>\r\n                <a className=\"article-types\" href=\"/\">\r\n                  tutorials\r\n                </a>\r\n                <p className=\"article-tags\"> Tags: #tag #tag #tag #tag #tag</p>\r\n                <div className=\"table-of-content\">\r\n                  <p>Table of Content:</p>\r\n                  <ul>\r\n                    <li onClick={()=>{scrollTo(\"#tc-title\")}}><p>Title</p></li>\r\n                    <li onClick={()=>{scrollTo(\"#tc-introduction\")}}><p>Introduction</p></li>\r\n                    <li onClick={()=>{scrollTo(\"#tc-games\")}}><p>Feature Games</p></li>\r\n                    <li onClick={()=>{scrollTo(\"#tc-friends\")}}><p>Making Friends</p></li>\r\n                  </ul>\r\n                </div>\r\n              </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Article;\r\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
