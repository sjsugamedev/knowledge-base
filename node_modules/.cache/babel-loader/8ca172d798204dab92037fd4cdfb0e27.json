This conversation directly followed the release of Tezca: In The Shadows, a first person horror game made by a team of Animation students and three student programmers. The game took a year to make and during that time, development was pretty rocky due to miscommunications between artists and programmers and a lack of testing. Seeing this, Cole, James, and Tom aimed to come up with a set of strategies to help students work together to create fantastic games. Originally, these ideas were to be documented and dubbed as Best Practices for Game Design and Development. Every failure and success from teams at SJSU would be used to iterate Best Practices into the most effective strategies and tips. Eventually, Best Practices evolved into a more decentralized format known as Knowledge Base, a site where anyone can share their ideas.\"\n                }, void 0, false, {\n

This conversation\r\n                    directly followed the release of Tezca: In The Shadows, a\r\n                    first person horror game made by a team of Animation\r\n                    students and three student programmers. The game took a year\r\n                    to make and during that time, development was pretty rocky\r\n                    due to miscommunications between artists and programmers and\r\n                    a lack of testing. Seeing this, Cole, James, and Tom aimed\r\n                    to come up with a set of strategies to help students work\r\n                    together to create fantastic games. Originally, these ideas\r\n                    were to be documented and dubbed as Best Practices for Game\r\n                    Design and Development. Every failure and success from teams\r\n                    at SJSU would be used to iterate Best Practices into the\r\n                    most effective strategies and tips. Eventually, Best\r\n                    Practices evolved into a more decentralized format known as\r\n                    Knowledge Base, a site where anyone can share their ideas.\r\n                  </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n              </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          <div className=\"right\"></div>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default About;\r\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
