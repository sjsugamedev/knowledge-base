Your code\r\n                    will be online and others can collaborate with you remotely.\r\n                    When you download GitHub Desktop, it will automatically\r\n                    download git on to your computer.\r\n                  </p>\r\n                  <p>\r\n                    Git:https://git-scm.com/ <br></br>\r\n                    GitHub: https://github.com/features\r\n                  </p>\r\n                  <p>\r\n                    There are some git concepts that you should know. Commits\r\n                    are the different versions of your project. It’s up to you\r\n                    how many updates a single commit will have, you'll know more\r\n                    about that later. Whenever you see “Commit your changes,”\r\n                    that means creating a commit. Git allows other people to\r\n                    work together on the same project using branches. These are\r\n                    separate safe zones that can be created and worked in\r\n                    without affecting other branches. Each branch contains their\r\n                    own commits and to get commits from another branch, you’ll\r\n                    need to merge the branches.\r\n                  </p>\r\n                  <p>\r\n                    GitHub has some concepts that may be confusing. First,\r\n                    projects are called repositories. Pushing means uploading\r\n                    and Pulling means downloading. The Origin means the\r\n                    repository stored in the cloud. You will be pulling commits\r\n                    from the origin and pushing your commits to the origin.\r\n                  </p>\r\n                  <h3 className=\"article-heading\">\r\n                    I’m the host of the project\r\n                  </h3>\r\n                  <p>\r\n                    Whoever has started the project will need to upload the\r\n                    files to GitHub. You can do this through the desktop\r\n                    application via two ways\r\n                    <ol>\r\n                      <li>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                          Make the local repository, then save the project file\r\n                          the repo file location.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                      </li>\r\n                      <li>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                          Make the project first, then create the local\r\n                          repository.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                      </li>\r\n                    </ol>\r\n                  </p>\r\n                  <p>\r\n                    Click File → New repository. A window will appear where you\r\n                    can name your repo and choose your local installation\r\n                    location. Look to see if there is a .gitignore file for your\r\n                    editor. There is one for Unity and Unreal. The .gitignore\r\n                    tells git to ignore files that don’t need to be shared to\r\n                    other users and makes collaborating easier.\r\n                  </p>\r\n                  <p>\r\n                    If you followed process 1, then go to your editor and save\r\n                    your project to the newly created repo folder. If you\r\n                    followed process 2, then drag your project file into the\r\n                    repo folder.\r\n                  </p>\r\n                  <p>\r\n                    One those steps are created, you should see changes recorded\r\n                    in GitHub Desktop (Fig. 2). If you’re using Unity, check\r\n                    “Note for Unity” below first. When you’re ready, write a\r\n                    summary of the changes, “Uploaded project” is fine. Then\r\n                    press commit changes.\r\n                  </p>\r\n                  <p>\r\n                    Note for Unity<br></br>\r\n                    There are two things to know.\r\n                  </p>\r\n                  <p>\r\n                    First, make sure the whole team is using the same version of\r\n                    Unity. If you all have different versions, then you’ll\r\n                    experience issues in Git syncing.\r\n                  </p>\r\n                  <p>\r\n                    Second, the default gitignore for Unity usually doesn’t\r\n                    work. If your project is stored in a subfolder in the repo\r\n                    folder, then GitHub Desktop will most likely show over a 100\r\n                    changes (Fig. 1). Since this is a new project, you should\r\n                    have less than 30 changes (Fig. 2). This is because your\r\n                    .gitignore is assuming the project is in the root folder,\r\n                    not in a folder within the root folder. Edit the .gitignore\r\n                    by removing the ‘/’ in front of the file directories listed\r\n                    at the top of the file. See images below\r\n                  </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div className=\"article-img\">\r\n                  <img className=\"img-full\" src={HeroImg}></img>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div className=\"article-img\">\r\n                  <img className=\"img-full\" src={HeroImg}></img>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div className=\"article-img\">\r\n                  <img className=\"img-full\" src={HeroImg}></img>\r\n                </div>\r\n\r\n                <p>\r\n                  <u>Publishing Repo</u>\r\n                  <br></br>\r\n                  Now publish the repository if you haven’t done it already. You\r\n                  should see that option as one of the buttons on the top. Once\r\n                  you publish the repo, you might have another option called\r\n                  “Push Origin.” Go ahead and press that too, look at the\r\n                  “Uploading Changes” section below for more details on that.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                  This requires that you have a GitHub account. Click here for\r\n                  help\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                  <u>Inviting your team to collaborate</u>\r\n                  <br></br>\r\n                  It’s important that everyone who will be collaborating on this\r\n                  project has a GitHub account. The repo that you have created\r\n                  is hosted on GitHub which takes care of the online syncing.\r\n                  The next important thing is that each member is invited to\r\n                  collaborate on the project. Anyone can download the repository\r\n                  you have uploaded, but they don’t have permission to make\r\n                  edits until they are official collaborators\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <div className=\"article-img\">\r\n                  <img className=\"img-full\" src={HeroImg}></img>\r\n                </div>\r\n\r\n                <p>\r\n                  This is the setting page of a GitHub repo (Fig. 3). Under\r\n                  ‘Manage access,’ you can see there are three collaborators for\r\n                  this project, and only these three people and the repo owner\r\n                  can make edits.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                  A <b>common problem</b> is that the repo owner will forget to\r\n                  invite someone and then a team member will try to add their\r\n                  changes. They will be prompted with a window asking if they\r\n                  would like to create a fork which is basically an exact, but\r\n                  separate, clone of the repo. This is super confusing for\r\n                  anyone not familiar with GitHub, but luckily it’s an easy\r\n                  problem to fix.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <h3 className=\"article-heading\">\r\n                  I’m trying to join the project\r\n                </h3>\r\n                <p>\r\n                  If you haven’t already, create a GitHub account. Send your\r\n                  GitHub username to whoever is the host of the project. It’s\r\n                  very important that you’re a collaborator of the GitHub\r\n                  repository. GitHub is a site that hosts projects that are\r\n                  using git for version and source code control. A repository is\r\n                  the name of a project hosted on GitHub. There are millions of\r\n                  public repositories on GitHub that you can view and download,\r\n                  but you can’t make edits to them unless you're a collaborator\r\n                  from them. The repo host must invite you to be a collaborator,\r\n                  otherwise, when you try to make edits, GitHub desktop will say\r\n                  you don’t have permission and will ask you to create a fork.\r\n                  <b>Don’t create a fork</b>, a fork is an exact, but separate, verison\r\n                  of the repo. Basically, you’ll be making changes to the wrong\r\n                  project!\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                To download a version of the project, you’ll need to clone the project. When you see or hear clone, just think of downloading the project. \r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                There are two ways to do this.<br></br>\r\nClone from GitHub desktop<br></br>\r\nClone from GitHub.com\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                Clone the project, choose where you want to store it, and then open the project.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <h3 className=\"article-heading\">\r\n                  Uploading Changes\r\n                </h3>\r\n                <p>\r\n                Git automatically your records changes and GitHub Desktop will list them under the Changes tab. In Figure 4, there are 26 changes that git sees. You can simply commit these changes, which is git's way of saying that these changes are good and ready to be sent to everyone else. To commit, simply add a comment and press the blue button at the button. Click here for a more detailed explanation. Then you have one more step, which is to push those changes.\r\n\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <div className=\"article-img\">\r\n                  <img className=\"img-full\" src={HeroImg}></img>\r\n                </div>\r\n\r\n                <p>\r\n                Pushing changes will upload them to the GitHub repo for everyone else to download. Once you committed, you should see a button at the top that will say “Push Origin.” There will be number in that button which will tell you how many commits you’ll be pushing.\r\n                Simply push the Push button to share your changes.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n              </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          <div className=\"right\">\r\n            <div className=\"content\">\r\n              <div className=\"print-menu\">\r\n                <a className=\"print-link\" href=\"\">\r\n                  Print Article\r\n                </a>\r\n                <hr className=\"line\"></hr>\r\n                <a className=\"article-types\" href=\"/\">\r\n                  tutorials\r\n                </a>\r\n                <p className=\"article-tags\"> Tags: #tag #tag #tag #tag #tag</p>\r\n              </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Article;\r\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
